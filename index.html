                <p><strong>Why Coding  ?</strong></p>
                      <p>My passion for coding started during my high school years when I
                          explored this enriching subject independently. I was soon entranced by all the
                          intricacies of coding and the hidden potentials of some of its contribution to technology
                          and other fields. Much seemingly dead information can be brought to life and be
                          masterfully weaved into useful information.
